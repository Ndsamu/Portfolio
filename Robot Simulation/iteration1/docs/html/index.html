Project Summary</h1>
<p>This project implements a simple game where the user controls a robot in attempting to evade obstacles while capturing all bases to win. All gameplay occurs in the <a class="el" href="classArena.html" title="The main class for the simulation of a 2D world with many entities running around. ">Arena</a> class. This is where time is advanced and all entity interaction is handled. Graphics simulation is generated from the <a class="el" href="classGraphicsArenaViewer.html" title="An application that uses the MinGfx library to open up a window that includes a few buttons for contr...">GraphicsArenaViewer</a> class which passes user inputs through the controller to the <a class="el" href="classArena.html" title="The main class for the simulation of a 2D world with many entities running around. ">Arena</a>. All entities are instantiated by the <a class="el" href="classEntityFactory.html" title="A factory for the instantiation of all types of arena entities. ">EntityFactory</a> class which sets each entity to its default parameters. These default parameters vary by class but consist predominantly of a <a class="el" href="structPose.html" title="A simple representation of the position/orientation of an entity within the Arena. ">Pose</a> (position &amp; heading angle) and radius. Entities exist as subclasses of the <a class="el" href="classArenaEntity.html" title="A base class from which all Arena entities inherit. ">ArenaEntity</a> class. The entities consist of the <a class="el" href="classArenaMobileEntity.html" title="A mobile entity in the Arena, capable of updating its own position and/or velocity when asked by the ...">ArenaMobileEntity</a> subclass and <a class="el" href="classArenaImmobileEntity.html" title="An immobile entity in the Arena. ">ArenaImmobileEntity</a> subclass. At this point in the project, the mobile entities consist of the robot and obstacles. The only immobile entities are the bases of the base class. For the mobile entities, motion is controlled by a <a class="el" href="classMotionHandler.html" title="Base class for managing the pose and wheel velocity of the entity. ">MotionHandler</a> class. Both robots and obstacles have their own motion handler subclasses, <a class="el" href="classMotionHandlerRobot.html" title="Class managing a Robot&#39;s speed and heading angle based on collisions and user inputs. ">MotionHandlerRobot</a> and <a class="el" href="classMotionHandlerObstacle.html" title="Class managing a Obstacle&#39;s speed and heading angle based on collisions and user inputs. ">MotionHandlerObstacle</a> respectively. This is where velocity and heading angle of entities are calculated. Upon interaction between entities, for example an obstacle and wall, the <a class="el" href="classArena.html" title="The main class for the simulation of a 2D world with many entities running around. ">Arena</a> class will adjust the entity overlap in order to ensure entities cannot escape the map or overlap each other (there is a known bug which causes entities to “jump” over each other at times). If the entity interacting with the environment is a robot, then the robots HandleCollision method will be called which will decrement the robots lives by one unless the second entity is a base in which the base will be updated to captured (and change color to green) and the robots number of bases captured will be incremented by one. The handle collision method of the robot passes further information to the <a class="el" href="classArenaMobileEntity.html" title="A mobile entity in the Arena, capable of updating its own position and/or velocity when asked by the ...">ArenaMobileEntity</a> subclass of <a class="el" href="classSensorTouch.html" title="Class representing a touch sensor. ">SensorTouch</a> which is used to calculate the point of contact between entities. This is used to adjust the overlap between entities. If the robot does lose a life then it is given a mercy invincibility time of two seconds where further lives cannot be lost and the robot’s color will flash. All of this interaction is handled in the arena in the UpdateEntitiesTimestep method. When the user opens the application the simulation will be paused, the user must select the “Play” button in order for the arena to begin updating entities. The user can pause the game at any time with the “Pause” button and continue play, again with the “Play” button. Upon the robot’s lives reaching zero or all bases being captured the robot’s color will change and the game will halt further updates. The user will be allowed to select the New Game which resets all entities by calling their reset method which places them randomly in the arena (except robot which returns to its origin). This also resets robots lives and captured bases. Any base will be set back to uncaptured. </p>
